# FileRenameScript
these scripts were made for the purpose of renaming video files for my plex server to have a naming scheme that can be recongnized by plex.

removeSeason is made so you can remove a selected set of text from all the files in a directory. 
to use this, change the .mkv after the *. in the first line of the for loop whatever file extension you are using.
next change the s20 in the third line of the for loop to what you want removed from all the files in the directory.
thats all thats needed to be changed to run this script.

renameScript is made to add characters at a point you want in all file names in a directory.
to change it for what you need, chnage the s20 to what characters you want to add.
next change the 17 to what index or coulumn you want to insert the new character(s) at

these scripts are recurrsive and will change all the file names in the directory it is running so be aware of that before you do.
i found these scripts online and wanted them in a spot so i hopefully wont lose them. i didnt write them or take credit for them, just want to share my findings.
